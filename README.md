# The Minecraftn't Website
This is the source code for the Minecraftn't website. It uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator, and is hosted on Github Pages.

## Setting up locally
1. Install Jekyll. The [`jekyll`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jekyll/) AUR package is pretty good.
2. Run `jekyll serve`.
3. Navigate to `127.0.0.1:4000` in your browser.
