## Extras
In addition to Minecraftn't, there are some extra projects to go along with it.

### Minecraftn't Classic
Minecraftn't Classic is a game developed in a similar vein to Minecraftn't, but as a recreation of Minecraft Classic (c0.30) with some extra optional [CPE](https://wiki.vg/Classic_Protocol_Extension) bits.

### Minecraftn't-Contrib
Minecraftn't-Contrib is a mod developed by the Minecraftn't developers to add various additional features to Minecraftn't. Some that are taken from newer versions of Minecraft, and some that are completely original, **but still in the Alpha spirit!**
